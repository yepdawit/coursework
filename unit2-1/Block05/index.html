        <h2 id="Bears">Bears</h2>
        <p>Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear). They’re found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.

            They have nonretractable claws, short tails, and excellent sense of smell. They’re typically solitary, except for mothers with cubs. There are eight species: Asiatic black bears (also called moon bears), brown bears (which include grizzly bears), giant pandas, North American black bears, polar bears, sloth bears, spectacled bears (also called Andean bears), and sun bears.
            
            On average, bears can live up to 25 years in the wild and 50 in captivity. Six species, including the polar bear and the giant panda, are included on the IUCN Red List as threatened or vulnerable.</p>

        <p>Ollie is a large adult male with narrowly-set eyes, a prominent brow ridge, and a distinctive scar across his muzzle. Even at his leanest, Ollie carries substantial fat reserves, especially on his hind quarters. In early summer he tends to shed much of the fur around his shoulders and neck. This gives him a two-toned appearance and exposes numerous scars and wounds. By late summer, his newly grown fur is dark brown</p>
        <p>Mona is a large adult female with a long straight muzzle and conspicuously blond ears. During late summer and fall, she has grizzled, light brown fur and is often one of the fattest bears to utilize Brooks River. In 2022, she returned to the river with twin 2.5 year-old cubs.</p>

        <h2 id="Giraffes">Giraffes</h2>
        <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.</p>

        <p>Frankie the giraffe, loves to count but is bedazzled by the stripes of the zebras and the splotches of the cheetah and utterly fails to count all their spots and stripes. But then she discovers there is one thing she is good at counting because of her very long neck – the stars. Beautifully illustrated across spreads that suggest the wide savannah and the large open night skies of Africa and where the size of Frankie is emphasised by having her half disappear off the page. Lovely splotchy end pages too.</p>
        <p>Coconut is a giraffe, keen to make friends but when he bends down low to say hello to the tiny meerkats (my best illustration in the book) he stumbles. And when he tries to make friends at the watering hole, he slips and slides. Fed up with being clumsy and unappreciated, Coconut is finally able to find friends between the leaves of a tall tree with the monkeys and birds, who also love tall trees where "You can reach as high as the sky… and see as far as the stars!"</p>

        <p>Mella is very laid back and enjoys participating in training sessions with his animal care team. At over 430 lbs., Mella is the largest lion at the Zoo.</p>
        <p>Even as an adult, Karl continues to be a playful and curious lion. She has an excellent relationship with her mother and her animal care team. Karl looks a lot like Zuri, but she is still slightly smaller than mom and has a lighter coat.</p>

        <p>Cookie, a sweet 30-year-old male capuchin monkey, is enjoying his post-service life here at the Monkey Living Center. (In 2006, Cookie was placed with Robert, a young man in Texas, and they had over ten wonderful years together until Robert passed away.) Cookie loves his baths and can’t wait for his treats of walnuts, oatmeal, and peanut butter – in fact, he taps the counter when he is ready for a treat!</p>
        <p>Good things come in small packages! Don’t let her size fool you. Earl is quite the self-assured and independent little lady.
            Earl is a 34-year-old post-service monkey who enjoys spending her time with Alison and other monkeys, especially her BFFs Lucy and Sadie</p>
        <p>Sweet Pudding is a 36-year-old monkey enjoying her post-service years with her best friends Kyla and Toby at Helping Hands. She has helped multiple people over her many years and now deserves the very best care we can provide for her. Pudding loves all food and will happily munch on any treat you give her.</p>

        <p>Wren is not your average alligator. His owner Joseph Henney has described how they first met. This gator is now seven years old and five and a half feet long. They met back in 2015 when Joseph was asked to take in some alligators that had been found in a pond in Florida. His hobby was caring for reptiles and he had been helping to relocate them for the last 30 years. He bonded with the then 14-month-old Wren and decided to keep him. He also noticed that Wren never tried to bite him and would not eat live rats – he preferred cheesy popcorn!</p>
        <p>Aspen has turned into an emotional support alligator and started to attend swim parties, schools and summer camps. We see him here in a pool with two little girls and when asked why they think Wally is so nice one answers “I think because he was born nice.”</p>
        <p>Mika is a baby Gator. she was born 6 month ago and growing so fast. Her favorite food is wagyu steak cooked in a medium rare temprature.</p>
